I was inspired to write this paper after learning about the significance of intellectual property (IP) for artistic works in my IP class last year. I continue to this day still pondering about the subject. If you are intrigued by the idea, please contact me. I would love to get an intellectual dialogue going!</i></div>
            <div class = "project_title">Intellectual Property For The Purely Mechanical</div>
            <div class = "subtitle_description">On April 2016, Looiersgracht 60, an Amsterdam art gallery, unveiled a new painting of the 17th century Dutch artist, Rembrandt van Rijn. The painting, which shows Rembrandt himself looking away, has been complimented for its rich colours, subtle emotion, characteristic brushstrokes, and evocative play of light and shadow so characteristic of the Dutch master's style.</div>
            <img class = "rembrant" src = "../images/rembrant.jpg">
            <div class = "image_subtitle">Image collected from: http://wired.jp/wp-content/gallery/160413rembrandt/01-203192-_c6a4527-93b479-large-1460022137.jpg</div>
            <div class = "subtitle_description">
                    However, there is a reason why this new painting, called "The Next Rembrant", has the tech world buzzing more than the art world. It turns out that this wasn't one of Rembrandt's long-lost works, but rather astonishingly, painted by an artificial intelligence which was created by developers from Microsoft and Delft University of Technology.
                <p>The significance of this achievement is huge because it shows just how capable computers are compared to humans when it comes to being creative. It also disproves exactly what Detective Del Spooner in the movie I, Robot said to Sonny, the robot central to the plot of the movie:</p>
                <p class = "quote">"You are just a machine. An imitation of life. Can a robot write a symphony? Can a robot turn a canvas into a beautiful masterpiece?"</p>
                <p>Think again, Spooner.</p>
                <p>A computer-generated work (CGW) is defined as a creative work which is produced via the output of an AI. What makes this concept confusing is the fact that some programmer had to first create the AI, before the AI could go on to create the CGW.</p>
            </div>
            <img class = "cgw" src = "../images/cgw.jpg">
            <div class = "image_subtitle cgw">Illustrates the "Order of Causation" of CGW: from the programmer, to the software, and then to the output.</div>
        <div class = "subtitle_description">
            With this in mind, you may think that the final creation is actually a human-generated work instead of CGW. But the human didn't actually generate the creative work, the computer did. All the programmer did was create an AI which could then go on to create a CGW. This means that the software which makes up the AI is a human-generated work, and the creative output of the AI would be a computer-generated work.
            <p>In order to better understand the context of CGW, I will provide an analogy with CGW to my mom teaching me how to draw a tree:</p>
            <p class = "quote">Me: So if you taught me how to draw that tree *points at the tree in the drawing*, then wouldn't the drawing be considered be your work?</p>
            <p class = "quote">Mom: No, it would still technically be considered as your work, because you drew it. There's a difference between someone teaching you how to draw a tree versus actually drawing the tree for you.</p>
            <p>This explains that as much as someone can teach me how to do a thing, I'm the one who actually placed in the effort to do the thing, and so, it should be considered my thing.

            What makes things more complicated is when copyright comes into play. By definition, <a class = "underline" href = "http://www.dictionary.com/browse/copyright"> "copyright" </a>is "the exclusive right to make copies, license, and otherwise exploit a literary, musical, or artistic work, whether printed, audio, video, etc". Copyright is like a badge claiming that “this is my thing”, and if someone wants to do something with your thing, then that person has to get permission from you. In most cases, the badge-holder will allow that person to use their creation for a set price or series of conditions. So in the context of CGW, who owns the badge: the AI, the programmer, or nobody?</p>

            <p>Understanding the degree to which the programmer has contributed to the output is the main question that needs to be answered if we want to know who should own the copyright. And even if we knew this degree, would we want the programmer to own the copyright? It's important to note that a party does not necessarily have to hold the entire copyright in a CGW. In our society, there exist different degrees of copyright that an individual can obtain and we obtain this right from policy makers.</p>

            <p>Other questions, need to also be addressed. Such as, would a computer ever experience a "creative block"? And if so, who's responsible for this? This is especially important to know if a CGW-producing computer were to ever work for, let's say, an advertising agency - meaning that if the computer is in "creative block" it won't be able to produce ads for the agency, hence placing the companies survival at risk. Another question to address is, would it be right to make these decisions about ownership without an AI's permission? These are a few of the many unanswered questions that must be addressed if we want to safely approach copyright for CGW. Until we reach some conclusion about the degree to which an AI should own the copyright of a CGW, if at all, will we ever be able to control how CGW will affect society? </p>

            <p>Un/lucky for us, not many countries have acknowledged CGW, meaning that we still have time to shape the outcome. <a class = "underline" href = "http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/part/I/chapter/I/crossheading/authorship-and-ownership-of-copyright"> The United Kingdom (1988)</a>, <a class = "underline" href = "http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1994/0143/latest/DLM345899.html"> New Zealand (1994) </a>, <a class = "underline" href = "http://www.nlsa.ac.za/downloads/Copyright%20Act.pdf"> South Africa (1978) </a>, and <a class = "underline" href = "http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2000/act/28/enacted/en/pdf"> Ireland (2000) </a> are the only countries that have acknowledged the existence of CGW in their copyright provisions. They collectively suggest in their provisions that an AI would be the owner of any produced CGW's, defining the party of ownership as "the person by whom the arrangements necessary for the creation of the work are undertaken." This suggests that the programmer could potentially own the work since they provided the preliminary code in order for the work to be created.</p>

            <p>There are some countries, such as the <a class = "underline" href = "http://www.copyright.gov/title17/">United States</a>, who explicitly exclude authorship by non-humans: “In order to be entitled to copyright registration, a work must be the product of human authorship. Works produced by mechanical processes or random selection without any contribution by a human author are not registerable" (2014). This policy is interesting considering that, a bit over a decade before, the U.S. concluded in two technology reports (<a class = "underline" href = "http://digital-law-online.info/CONTU/contu-toc.html">CONTU</a> and <a class = "underline" href = "http://ota.fas.org/reports/8600.pdf">OTA</a>) that CGW was important, but also far too speculative to consider at the time. Based off this, why does the U.S. state in their copyright bill that non-humans (note: CGW = a non-human creation) cannot be considered for copyright protection? Did the U.S. completely disregard the technology reports it originally wrote?</p>

            <p>It appears that most countries are waiting until CGW requires immediate attention in order to properly address it. And, unfortunately, when laws require immediate attention, countries tend to not bother going to the public (it's much quicker to make decisions in- house). This may or may not be the most ideal outcome which means that we (the people) must step in now so we can control the outcome.</p>

            If you care about this issue. Here is what I recommend to get involved:
            <p><mark class="pink">1. Educate yourself:</mark> To truly understand the complexity of this issue, I would suggest reading <a class = "underline" href = "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1888622">this article</a> published by Stanford Law. The main topics to educate yourself on should be: machine learning, intellectual property, origins of creativity, and AI philosophy.</p>
            <p><mark class="pink">2. Contact me: </mark> I'm hoping to raise awareness of this issue while also helping shape the law for CGW. If you would like to help out, please contact ovtownsend@gmail.com.</p>
            <p><mark class="pink">3. Get in touch with organizations: </mark> <a class = "underline" href = "https://openai.com/blog/team-update/">OpenAI,</a> for example, is a non-profit artificial intelligence research company, associated with business magnate Elon Musk, that aims to carefully promote and develop open-source friendly AI in such a way as to benefit, rather than harm, humanity as a whole.</p>
