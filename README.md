This was my personal website back when I was more orientated as a designer. It displays many of the design projects Iâ€™ve done. 

The website was fully designed by myself and most code development was independently done as well. 

If you wish to try out the website, follow these steps:

1. Download this repository.
2. Double click on index.html. This should automatically bring you to your web browser with my website opened. Navigate as you would with a website. 

Alternatively, you can view the screenshot files uploaded to have a glance of certain pages on the website. These are contained in the folder website_screenshots. View homepage.pdf to see the homepage screen, SDZ_postcard.pdf to learn about my favourite design project, and design_process.pdf to understand my design proccess.

Enjoy!
